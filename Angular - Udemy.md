A reactive single-page application, all changes are rendered in the browser. It utilises Javascript to render changes much faster than reaching out to a server for each change. Since Angular is a JS framework, it changes the DOM during runtime.

### Typescript
A strict syntactical superset of Javascript which is a strongly typed language which is compiled to JavaScript.

### How Angular loads and displays components
The single-page aspect comes from only index.html being served, however, it contains an `<app-root>` component generated by the CLI. 
On compilation, the index.html file injects a set of bundle scripts such as `inline.bundle.js`, `polyfills.bundle.js` etc... One of the injections is `main.ts` which is responsible for bootstrapping the Angular application (`app.module.ts`)
Within `app.module.ts`, theres a bootstrapper for launching the AppComponent, this is only for the root component

| Bundle name | Purpose |
| - | - |
| inline | WebPack |
| polyfills | Browser compatability |
| main | Angular files |
| styles | Styles |
| vendor | 3rd party libraries |

`ng-serve` will compiles and runs the application from memory purely for development
`ng-build` will compile the application producing build files used for deployment

<i>Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT)</i> compilation is done during the build
<i>Just In Time Compilation (JIT)</i> compilation is done during runtime


### Components
Each component has it's own template and business logic
The `@Component` class decorator is needed for Angular to identify a .ts file as a component
`ng g c componentname`

```TS
import { component } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
	selector: 'app-home', 
	templateUrl: './home.component.html'
})
```

| Selector Option | Html Reference | Type |
| - | - | - |
| `app-home` | `<app-home></app-home>` | Element |
| `[app-home]`| `<div app-home></div>` | Attribute |
| `.app-home` | `<div class="app-home"></div>` | Class |


### App Module
```TS
import { BroswerModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http'

import { AppComponent } from './app.component'
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component'

@NgModule({
	declarations: [ //Declares components within this module
		AppComponent,
		HomeComponent
	],
	imports: [ //Declares the packages needed for this module
		BrowserModule,
		HttpModule
	],
	providers: [
	],
	bootstrap: [
		AppComponent
	]
})
```

### Databinding
A link between Typescript and HTML

One-Way: TypeScript interacting with HTML
```TS
{{ data }}          //String interpolation with a string property's value 
{{ data ? "Data exists" : "Data missing" }}
{{ getData() }}     //String interpolation with a function call returning a string

[property]="data" //Property Binding
```

One-Way: HTML interacting with TypeScript
```html
<input (event="expression")></input>

<button 
	class="btn btn-primary" disabled>                 <!--disabled is hardcoded-->
	Press Me
</button>

<!--Using [] allows Angular to interact with the DOM-->
<button
	class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!isDisabled"> <!--bind disabled to isDisabled-->
	Press Me
</button>

<p>{{ title }}</p>          <!--String interpolation--> 
<p [innerText]="title"></p> <!--Property binding-->
```

Use String Interpolation Binding for displaying a property
Use Property binding for changing a property

Two-Way Binding
```TS
[(ngModel)]="data"
```

### Event Binding
<a href="https://angular.io/guide/event-binding">Angular.io/event-binding</a>
```TS
onCreateHome() {
	this.homePageCreatedStatus = 'Home page was created'
}
```

```HTML
<button 
	(click)="onCreateHome()"> <!--(eventName)="functionCall()"-->
</button>
```
